"""
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Example 1:

Input: s = "zxyzxyz"

Output: 3
Explanation: The string "xyz" is the longest without duplicate characters.

Example 2:

Input: s = "xxxx"

Output: 1
Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 1000
s may consist of printable ASCII characters.
